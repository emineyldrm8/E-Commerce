# E-commerce Application

This project is a fully functional e-commerce application that I developed using Spring Boot, MySQL, and Elasticsearch. It showcases how to build a scalable and flexible online shopping platform with both relational and non-relational data storage systems.

## Project Overview

The application provides a seamless e-commerce experience, allowing users to browse products, manage their shopping cart, and place orders. It integrates Spring Boot for creating a robust backend, MySQL for structured data storage, and Elasticsearch for enhanced search functionality. Spring Boot serves as the backbone of the application, offering a modular, RESTful architecture that handles complex operations like user management, product cataloging, and order processing.

## Key Features

- **Spring Boot Backend**: Provides REST APIs for the frontend, handling requests for user authentication, product listing, cart management, and order processing.
- **User Management**: Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles, with role-based access for different types of users.
- **Product Management**: Supports a product catalog with attributes like name, description, price, and stock. Spring Boot integrates with MySQL for data persistence and with Elasticsearch for fast and flexible product searches.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add items to their shopping cart, adjust quantities, and proceed to checkout.
- **Order Processing**: Generates orders based on the cart's content, tracks them, and saves them for historical data.
- **Address Management**: Allows users to manage multiple addresses organized by district, city, and county.
- **Role-Based Access**: Different roles are defined within the application to control access permissions.

## Technology Stack

- **Spring Boot**: Acts as the core of the application, providing a RESTful API layer, managing dependencies, and enabling rapid development with Java.
- **MySQL**: Used as the primary relational database, storing structured data such as user details, product information, and orders.
- **Elasticsearch**: Integrated to handle search functionality, allowing efficient and flexible searching capabilities across the product catalog.

## ER Diagram

The data schema manages complex relationships, including users, products, carts, orders, addresses, and roles. Each table is structured to ensure efficient data handling and retrieval, leveraging Spring Bootâ€™s JPA support to map database entities seamlessly.
